<h2>Answer:<a class="headerlink" href="#answer" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Confounding is a critical concept in causal inference, referring to a situation where the observed relationship between a treatment or exposure and an outcome is distorted by the presence of another variable, known as a confounder. Confounders are variables that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome, potentially leading to a spurious association that does not reflect a true causal relationship.</p>
<section id="background-and-intuition">
<h3>Background and Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#background-and-intuition" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>To understand confounding, consider a scenario where a researcher is interested in estimating the causal effect of a new drug on disease recovery. Suppose that age is a confounder: older individuals are both more likely to take the drug and have a different recovery rate from the disease. If age is not accounted for, the estimated effect of the drug on recovery may be biased.</p>
<p>Mathematically, let $T$ be the treatment variable (e.g., drug usage), $Y$ the outcome variable (e.g., recovery), and $C$ the confounder (e.g., age). The goal is to estimate the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$, often denoted as $E[Y \mid \text{do}(T=t)]$ using Pearl’s do-calculus. However, if $C$ influences both $T$ and $Y$, the observed association $E[Y \mid T=t]$ could be confounded.</p>

<h3>Detailed Answer<a class="headerlink" href="#detailed-answer" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Stratification</strong>: Stratification involves dividing the data into subgroups (or strata) based on the levels of the confounder and then estimating the treatment effect within each stratum. By conditioning on the confounder, we effectively block the confounding path, aiming to isolate the causal pathway from treatment to outcome.</p>
<p>For example, if age is a confounder, we can stratify the data by age groups and estimate the causal effect of the drug within each age group. The overall effect can then be assessed by averaging these stratified estimates, weighted by the size of each stratum.</p>
<p><strong>Regression Adjustment</strong>: Regression adjustment involves including the confounder as a covariate in a regression model. This approach attempts to statistically control for the confounder by adjusting the estimated effect of the treatment. In a linear regression context, we estimate a model such as:</p>
<p>$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 C + \epsilon $$</p>
<p>Here, $\beta_1$ represents the adjusted effect of $T$ on $Y$, accounting for the confounder $C$.</p>

<section id="limitations">
<h3>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Residual Confounding</strong>: Both stratification and regression adjustment assume that the confounder has been measured accurately and completely. If there are unmeasured or poorly measured confounders, these techniques will not fully account for confounding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Specification</strong>: Regression adjustment relies on the correct specification of the model. Misspecification can lead to biased estimates. For example, if the relationship between the confounder and the outcome is nonlinear and a linear model is used, the adjustment may be inadequate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Dimensionality</strong>: Stratification becomes impractical with high-dimensional confounders, as the number of strata grows exponentially with the number of confounders, leading to sparse data in each stratum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interaction Effects</strong>: If there are interactions between the treatment and the confounder, simple stratification or regression adjustment without interaction terms may not capture the true effect heterogeneity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causal Interpretation</strong>: Both methods provide estimates under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which is a strong assumption. In practice, it’s often hard to verify.</p></li>
